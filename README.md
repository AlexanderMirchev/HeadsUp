# HeadsUp

Heads up is a game for describing words. The player who has to guess the word puts the mobile device on his forhead with the screen facing towards the other people. Their goal is to describe the word displayed on the device. If the player says the word out loud, he can tilt the phone downwards and score a point. Otherwise at any given time the player can tilt the phone upwards and pass the word. Each round is one minute long.
